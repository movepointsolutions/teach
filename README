teach
=====

teach is a Model/Algorithm framework.
You start with an algorithm.
The algorithm has a connected model.
Model emits key/value pairs to business logic.
You could have a models tree, represented with a root model.
Algorithm is connected to a single model.
More exactly, the single teach::algorithm template parameter
is type of pointer to model.

To have models emit and thus start business logic,
you call algorithm::transport(k, v).

For exact idea, look at the sample code.

To see that test.c++ works:
$ mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make && ./test
